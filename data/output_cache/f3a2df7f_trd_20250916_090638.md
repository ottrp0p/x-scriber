# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
The project focuses on job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers. The main objective is to provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address. This aliased email will be utilized for all job applications. Routing rules for this email will be controlled on the project's domain to intercept emails using a service like S3. The project will manage the domain to store copies of all job-related emails, especially responses from ATS systems confirming job application submissions.

## Requirements
- The system must provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address.
- The aliased email generated must be used for all job applications by the users.
- The system should have the capability to control the routing rules for the aliased email on the organization's domain.
- It should allow the monitoring of emails in transit, possibly utilizing an S3 service.
- The system must manage the domain to store a copy of every job application email.
- The system needs to identify emails that are responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used in job applications, including confirmation emails.

## Technical Specifications
* The system is designed for job funnel analytics or job CRM, targeting potential job seekers.
* The system will provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email.
* Users are required to use the aliased email for all job applications.
* Routing rules for the aliased email on the system's domain will be controlled by the system.
* The system will monitor and intercept emails in transit, potentially utilizing an S3 service.
* The system will manage the domain to store a copy of every job application email.
* The system will identify and save emails that are responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used in job applications, including application confirmations.

## Architecture
The system architecture for the job funnel analytics or job CRM is designed to cater to potential job seekers. The primary objective is to offer an aliased email that forwards to their regular email address. This aliased email will be utilized in all job applications. The architecture involves the following components and processes:
- **Aliased Email System**:
- Provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address.
- This aliased email will be used for all job applications by the job seekers.
- **Routing Rules Control**:
- Control the routing rules for the aliased email on the organization's domain.
- Manage the domain to enable monitoring and interception of emails in transit.
- **Email Monitoring and Storage**:
- Utilize an S3 service to sniff and capture emails in transit.
- Save a copy of every job application email on the organization's domain.
- Specifically capture emails that are responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used in job applications.
This architecture ensures that all job application emails are intercepted, stored, and analyzed, particularly focusing on responses from ATS systems to track the progress of job applications effectively.

## Constraints
The system constraints for the job funnel analytics or job CRM project are as follows:
- The system must provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email for job applications.
- Routing rules for the aliased email must be controlled on the project's domain.
- The system should be capable of sniffing emails in transit, potentially utilizing an S3 service for this purpose.
- A copy of every job or email must be saved on the project's domain.
- The system must be able to identify and save responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) as confirmation of job applications.

## Assumptions
- The system is designed for job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers.
- The system will provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email for use in all job applications.
- Routing rules for the aliased email will be controlled on the organization's domain.
- The system will monitor and intercept emails in transit, possibly utilizing an S3 service.
- A copy of every job application email will be saved on the organization's domain.
- The system will identify and store emails that are responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) related to job applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Provide an aliased email for job seekers that forwards to their normal email.
- The aliased email must be used in all job applications.
- Control routing rules for the aliased email on the company's domain.
- Implement a method to intercept emails in transit, possibly utilizing an S3 service.
- Manage the domain to store a copy of every job application email.
- Identify and save responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) as confirmation of job applications.

Okay, so this is for the job funnel analytics or job CRM. This is geared towards potential job seekers. Ultimately, what we're trying to do here is to provide an aliased email that forwards to their normal email. This aliased email should be used in all of their job applications. Given that we should control the routing rules for this email on our own domain, we will use this to be able to be able to sniff the emails in transit, probably using some kind of S3 service, managing the domain where we will save a copy of every job or every email. For the emails that are determined to be responses from ATS systems from job applications, whether this is confirmation that somebody has applied.
**Dependencies:**
- S3 service for managing email routing and storage
- Domain management for controlling email routing rules
- Possibly additional services for email sniffing and analysis
