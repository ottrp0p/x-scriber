# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
The project focuses on job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers. The main objective is to provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address, to be used for all job applications. Routing rules for this email will be controlled on the project's domain to intercept emails using a service like S3. The project will manage the domain to store copies of all job-related emails, especially responses from ATS systems confirming job application submissions. Additionally, the system will analyze emails to determine the progress of job applications, including whether they proceed to the next round or are rejected. An LLM-powered service will read and interpret emails to track changes in the status of job applications.
This project also caters to career directors in a university setting, providing an administrative layer for aggregating user data and statistics. This layer allows career directors to view aggregate statistics of user groups they oversee and monitor individual activities, necessitating different user account management.
In terms of actual languages and frameworks used, the backend will be developed in FastAPI using Python. AWS will likely be utilized to manage the domains and sniff emails. The LLM component will have the flexibility to inject necessary functionalities. For the frontend, Next.js will be employed with TypeScript and JavaScript.
The primary focus initially will be on testing the functionality of the system before implementing the aliasing feature.

## Requirements

- The LLM-powered service should determine the job instance the email belongs to and assess the current status of the job application.
- The system must be able to differentiate between emails indicating progression to the next round or rejection.
- For career directors in a university setting, an administrative layer is required to aggregate users' data for statistical analysis.
- The administrative layer should provide an overview of aggregate statistics for a group of users and individual insights.
- Career directors will need a separate user account for accessing this administrative layer.
- The system backend will be developed using FastAPI in Python.
- AWS will be utilized to manage domains and sniff emails.
- The frontend will be built using Next.js with TypeScript and JavaScript.
- Initial steps will focus on testing the system's functionality before implementing the aliasing feature.
