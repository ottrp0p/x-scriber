# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
The project focuses on job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers. The main objective is to provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address, to be used for all job applications. Routing rules for this email will be controlled on the project's domain to intercept emails using a service like S3. The project will manage the domain to store copies of all job-related emails, especially responses from ATS systems confirming job application submissions. Additionally, the system will analyze emails to determine the progress of job applications, including whether they proceed to the next round or are rejected. An LLM-powered service will read and interpret emails to track changes in the status of job applications.
This project also caters to career directors in a university setting, providing an administrative layer for aggregating user data and statistics. This layer allows career directors to view aggregate statistics of user groups they oversee and monitor individual activities, necessitating different user account management.
In the latest development, a V0 version will initially use an adapter to existing Workspace Gmail accounts to pull emails for testing data. The system will utilize the Gmail API to fetch emails from a designated Workspace Gmail account used for job applications. The Gmail API will retrieve the data, which will then be processed by the LLM logic. The LLM logic, to be deployed as a service, will determine new threads, new applications, and updates on existing applications.
In terms of actual languages and frameworks used:
- The backend will be developed in FastAPI using Python.
- AWS will likely be utilized to manage the domains and sniff emails.
- The LLM component will have the flexibility to inject necessary functionalities.
- For the frontend, Next.js will be employed with TypeScript and JavaScript.
The primary focus initially will be on testing the functionality of the system before implementing the aliasing feature.
