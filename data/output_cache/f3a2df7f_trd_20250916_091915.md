# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
The project focuses on job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers, aiming to provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address for all job applications. The system will manage the domain to store copies of job-related emails, especially responses from ATS systems confirming job application submissions. Additionally, it will analyze emails to track job application progress, including advancement to the next round or rejection. An LLM-powered service will interpret emails to monitor changes in application status.
This project also caters to career directors in a university setting, offering an administrative layer for aggregating user data and statistics. Career directors can view aggregate statistics of user groups and individual activities, requiring distinct user account management.
In the latest development, a V0 version will use an adapter to pull emails from existing Workspace Gmail accounts for testing data. The system will utilize the Gmail API to fetch emails from a designated Workspace Gmail account for job applications. The LLM logic will process this data to identify new threads, applications, and updates on existing applications.
**Languages and Frameworks**:
- Backend: FastAPI in Python
- AWS for domain management and email sniffing
- LLM component flexibility for necessary functionalities
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript and JavaScript
**New Requirement**:

- The designated Workspace Gmail account will be used for job applications to generate testing data.
- Gmail API will be utilized to pull emails into the system for processing.
- LLM logic will be developed to determine new threads, new applications, and updates on existing applications.
- The LLM logic will be deployed as a service to analyze the emails effectively.
- The system will incorporate a MongoDB collection or set of collections in the analytics layer to store user information and track the status of individual job application threads.
- The MongoDB records will keep track of the status of threads, whether they are active, hot, cold, or at which stage of the job application they are.
- Authentication design for the frontend will likely revolve around Google Auth for user sign-ins.
**Updated Requirement**:
- The system will now incorporate a billing section with plans for Stripe integration to handle subscriptions.
- Specific considerations for Stripe may include an override function for users under university purview, possibly with bulk exceptions.
- An email verification system will likely be implemented to verify both the user's authentication email and university email for organizational affiliation.
In addition to the existing functionalities, the system will introduce three new pages:
- **Profile Page**:
