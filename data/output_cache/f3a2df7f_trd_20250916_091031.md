# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
The project focuses on job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers, aiming to provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address for all job applications. The system will manage the domain to store copies of job-related emails, especially responses from ATS systems confirming job application submissions. Additionally, it will analyze emails to track job application progress, including advancement to the next round or rejection. An LLM-powered service will interpret emails to monitor changes in application status.
This project also caters to career directors in a university setting, offering an administrative layer for aggregating user data and statistics. Career directors can view aggregate statistics of user groups and individual activities, requiring distinct user account management.
In the latest development, a V0 version will use an adapter to pull emails from existing Workspace Gmail accounts for testing data. The system will utilize the Gmail API to fetch emails from a designated Workspace Gmail account for job applications. The LLM logic will process this data to identify new threads, applications, and updates on existing applications.
**Languages and Frameworks**:
- Backend: FastAPI in Python
- AWS for domain management and email sniffing
- LLM component flexibility for necessary functionalities
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript and JavaScript
The primary focus initially will be on testing the system's functionality before implementing the aliasing feature. The analytics layer will be updated to include MongoDB records for user information and tracking individual job application threads. Authentication design for the frontend may involve Google Auth for user sign-ins.
