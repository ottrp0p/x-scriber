# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
The project focuses on job funnel analytics or job CRM for potential job seekers. The main objective is to provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address, to be used for all job applications. Routing rules for this email will be controlled on the project's domain to intercept emails using a service like S3. The project will manage the domain to store copies of all job-related emails, especially responses from ATS systems confirming job application submissions. Additionally, the system will analyze emails to determine the progress of job applications, including whether they proceed to the next round or are rejected. An LLM-powered service will read and interpret emails to track changes in the status of job applications.
This project also caters to career directors in a university setting, providing an administrative layer for aggregating user data and statistics. This layer allows career directors to view aggregate statistics of user groups they oversee and monitor individual activities, necessitating different user account management.

## Requirements
- The system must provide an aliased email that forwards to the user's normal email address.
- The aliased email generated must be used for all job applications by the users.
- The system should have the capability to control the routing rules for the aliased email on the organization's domain.
- It should allow the monitoring of emails in transit, possibly utilizing an S3 service.
- The system must manage the domain to store a copy of every job application email.
- The system needs to identify emails that are responses from Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used in job applications, including confirmation emails.
- The system must save all emails, passing them to an LLM-powered service for analysis.
- The LLM-powered service should determine the job instance the email belongs to and assess the current status of the job application.
- The system must be able to differentiate between emails indicating progression to the next round or rejection.
- For career directors in a university setting, an administrative layer is required to aggregate users' data for statistical analysis.
- The administrative layer should provide an overview of aggregate statistics for a group of users and individual insights.
- Career directors will need a separate user account for accessing this administrative layer.
