# Technical Requirements Document

## Overview
This project involves building a comprehensive user authentication system for a web application. The system will provide secure, multi-method authentication with role-based access control, following modern security best practices and microservices architecture patterns.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Support multiple login methods:
  - Email and password authentication
  - Google OAuth integration
  - GitHub OAuth integration
- Password reset functionality via email
- Role-based access control with three user roles:
  - Admin: Full system access
  - Editor: Content management access
  - Viewer: Read-only access
- JWT token-based session management
- 24-hour token expiration with refresh token functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- RESTful API design
- Microservices architecture pattern
- Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI specification

## Technical Specifications
### Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt
- **OAuth Providers**: Google, GitHub

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for all authentication operations
- JWT tokens for session management
- Refresh token mechanism for token renewal
- OpenAPI specification for complete API documentation

## Architecture
### Microservices Pattern
The system follows a microservices architecture with separate services for:
- **Authentication Service**: Handles login, logout, and token management
- **User Management Service**: Manages user profiles and account operations
- **Authorization Service**: Manages roles and permissions

### Service Communication
- Services communicate via REST APIs
- JWT tokens passed between services for user context
- Centralized configuration for OAuth providers

## Constraints
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens must be securely stored and rotated
- OAuth integrations must comply with provider security requirements
- Database connections must be properly pooled and managed
- All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds

## Assumptions
- Users will have valid email addresses for password reset functionality
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) will maintain stable API interfaces
- PostgreSQL database will be properly configured with appropriate indexes
- Network connectivity between microservices will be reliable
- SSL/TLS encryption will be implemented at the infrastructure level

## Acceptance Criteria
### Authentication
- [ ] Users can register with email and password
- [ ] Users can login with email and password
- [ ] Users can login via Google OAuth
- [ ] Users can login via GitHub OAuth
- [ ] Password reset emails are sent successfully
- [ ] Users can reset passwords using email links

### Authorization
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced
- [ ] Admin users have full system access
- [ ] Editor users can manage content
- [ ] Viewer users have read-only access
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly validated

### Security
- [ ] Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- [ ] JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- [ ] Refresh tokens work correctly
- [ ] OAuth integrations are secure
- [ ] API endpoints are properly protected

### Technical
- [ ] All APIs follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Microservices communicate correctly
- [ ] Database operations are efficient
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive

## Dependencies
### External Services
- Google OAuth API
- GitHub OAuth API
- Email service provider (for password reset)

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database server
- Redis cache (for session storage)
- Load balancer (for microservices)
- SSL certificate management

### Development Tools
- Node.js runtime environment
- Express.js framework
- JWT library
- bcrypt library
- OAuth client libraries
- Database migration tools
- API testing tools
